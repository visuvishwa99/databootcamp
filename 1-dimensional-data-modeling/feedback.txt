Thank you for your submission. After reviewing your code, I will provide feedback on each task to help you refine your SQL skills. Let's dive into the details:

### Task 1: DDL for actors table

- **Strengths:**
  - Correct use of custom type `films` to handle film data.
  - Correctly defined the primary key on `(actorid, current_year)`, ensuring uniqueness for each actor per year.

- **Improvements:**
  - No improvements needed. This task is well-executed.

### Task 2: Cumulative table generation query

- **Strengths:**
  - You correctly implemented a process to update the `actors` table year by year using `WITH` clauses and a stored procedure.

- **Improvements:**
  - When generating cumulative data, consider edge cases and ensure proper handling of edge conditions or empty entries in `actor_films` for certain years.

### Task 3: DDL for actors_history_scd table

- **Strengths:**
  - Good implementation of the type 2 dimension modeling with `start_date` and `end_date`.
  - Inclusion of `quality_class` and `is_active` as required fields.

- **Improvements:**
  - The choice of data type for `start_date` and `end_date` as `INT` is unusual if they represent date values. Typically, `DATE` types are used for real date values.
  - Ensure that all fields you track as `dimensions` fit logically into date-related components when using SCD modeling.

### Task 4: Backfill query for actors_history_scd

- **Strengths:**
  - Comprehensive approach with the use of multiple CTEs to handle data transformation and chronological tracking.

- **Improvements:**
  - Consider using `DATE` functions directly within the queries to improve clarity and ensure that the intended period coverage is maintained.
  - The transformation logic can lead to large queries; keeping sub-queries optimally nested can help in maintaining performance as system size grows.

### Task 5: Incremental query for actors_history_scd

- **Strengths:**
  - Clear design with logical separation between unchanged and changed records, using CTEs to manage complexity efficiently.

- **Improvements:**
  - Audit logic for handling cases when actor data resets or significantly changes to ensure older records are closed out correctly in the incremental updates.
  - Alignment of type concerns when working with complex types such as `scd_type` is crucial for maintaining intended behavior.

### General Feedback:

Your SQL skills are well-represented in dealing with complex data transformation tasks typically seen in ETL processes. Your work effectively uses SQL features like CTEs and window functions. Simple improvements and choices, particularly around data types and ensuring scalability, would help bring even more robustness to your SQL design patterns.

### FINAL GRADE:
```json
{
  "letter_grade": "A",
  "passes": true
}
```
Overall, your submission is solid, with some scope for optimization, particularly related to type selection and ensuring the clarity of operations. Well done!
