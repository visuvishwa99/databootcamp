Dear Student,

Thank you for your submission. I have reviewed your SQL queries for the data engineering tasks you’ve worked on. Here’s some feedback on the specific areas:

1. **De-duplication Query**:
   - The use of `ROW_NUMBER()` is on the right track to eliminate duplicates based on all columns of the `game_details` table. However, for better de-duplication, you should be testing `PARTITION BY game_id, team_id, player_id` since these are typically the unique identifiers for a game detail dataset. Be cautious using `gd.*`, as it partitions by every column.
   - Consider revisiting the partitioning strategy to align with likely unique keys like `game_id`, `team_id`, and `player_id`.

2. **User Devices Activity Datelist DDL**:
   - The table `user_devices_cumulated` is created with a date array for `device_activity_datelist`. This aligns well with the requirement to track active days over time. However, the comment suggests using either `MAP<STRING, ARRAY[DATE]>` or having `browser_type` as an explicit column.
   - To improve, ensure your design choice (either an array or a map) is clearly reflected, and if not using a separate column, clarify why `browser_type` is commented out.

3. **User Devices Activity Datelist Implementation**:
   - The query to populate `user_devices_cumulated` uses a sensible approach by leveraging a `FULL OUTER JOIN` between new events (`today`) and existing data (`yesterday`). This ensures you capture all user activity accurately as you accumulate it.
   - One area to improve is testing the `INNER JOIN` logic, avoiding possible coherence errors with the dates.

4. **User Devices Activity Int Datelist**:
   - Your transformation of `device_activity_datelist` into a bit-based integer representation (`datelist_int`) shows solid understanding. The use of `POW(2, 31 - days_since)` allows a direct mapping into a `BIT(32)`.
   - Ensure the dates used (`2023-01-31`) are dynamic if this is meant for continuous integration.

5. **Host Activity Datelist Implementation**:
   - While a specific prompt for this was not extracted in detail, your approaches in related tasks indicate understanding and capability to handle historical data capture incrementally.

6. **Reduced Host Fact Array Implementation**:
   - The incremental insertion logic for `host_activity_reduced` leverages a mix of `yesterday` and `today_metrics` datasets. You handle concurrency and conflicts well using the `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` clause.
   - As an improvement, simulate varying dates dynamically. This will ensure you prepare for potential scenarios beyond the single day provided ('2023-01-10').

Overall, your submission reflects a strong understanding of data handling concepts using SQL, with room for improvement in aligning and testing dynamic parts of your queries. Consider making refinement towards ensuring the handling keys for de-duplication and planning for continuous integration points more broadly.
